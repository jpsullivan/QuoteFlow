Protocols are provided to access measurement and alarm data such as spectra, identification results, dose rates or neutron count rates.  Detection Units can be configured into one of several available defined groups and advanced algorithms are available for analysis.  These powerful algorithms lower false alarm rates by combining and comparing individual results and provide a tracking capability to determine the location of a source.
